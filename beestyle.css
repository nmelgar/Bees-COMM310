/*READ THESE NOTES!*/

/*This document is filled with instructions/help in the form of comments*/

/*This is how you write a CSS comment*/

/*It is suggested that you work through this assignment by following the comments/prompts in this CSS file from top to bottom*/






/*You will use Class selectors on the following two rules*/


	/*Take a look at the declaration (property: value;) of the following rule. Find the two elements in the screenshot that are both syled with a yellow background. Notice that the screenshot provides you with the declaration (property: value;) that should be used in this CSS document. You will need to insert the class name showme into the appropriate opening tags in the HTML file (see page 184 for more information about class attributes)*/

	.showme{

		background-color: yellow;

	}

	/*NOTICE that this rule should be a class, but it is missing the class name. You will need to choose a name, make it something descriptive, for this class selector. You will also need to insert this class into the HTML*/

	.showme:last-child{

		text-transform: uppercase;

	}



/*The following three rules should use ID selectors*/


	/*You will need to give these ID selectors names, and place the ids into the correct places in the HTML. Use the screenshot to determine what tag these IDs need to be placed on (see page 183 for more information about ID attributes). */

	#production{

		color: purple;

	}

	/*This will change the Harvesting text color*/

	#harvesting{

		color: red;

	}

	#bottling{

		color: brown;

	}






/*The following two rules should use Type Selectors. Type selectors are just the keywords used in the HTML tags. For instance a paragraph tag looks like this <p>, and the correlating CSS Type Selector would just be p (see page 238 for more information about Type Selectors)*/


	/*You will need to insert the correct type selector for the next two rules*/

	header{
		border: dashed 1px green;

	}

	/*By default this will change your document to have all the paragraphs to be blue. A rule further down this page will change the color of the Production paragraph text to be green. Don't be confused when your document doesn't match the screenshot exactly just yet.*/

	p{

		color: blue;

	}






/*The following two rules should use a mix of selectors (ex: #someid p - which would grab all paragraphs inside the element with the id of someid). This will require you to understand how to read the selectors. Reference the "How to Read CSS Selectors" page in the Week 4 Day 1 iLearn folder. Another good reference would be page 238 of the book, which will describe the different types of selectors.*/



	/*You will need to insert a class named "bolded" into the HTML. */

	li .bolded{

		font-weight: bold;

	}

	/*You will need to insert an id into the HTML named "production-section" This has been named to describe the element it should be placed on. */

	#production-section p{

		color: green;
        
	}
    p:first-of-type {

		padding-left: 20px;
        
	}
    






/*The following three rules should use more advanced selectors. The exact selector type is outlined below.*/


	/*Use a Child selector for the following (see page 238 for more information about Child Selectors). This rule will change the links text color.*/

	li>a {

        color: red;

	}

	/*Use an Adjacent sibling selector for the following. The adjacent sibling selector matches an element that is the next sibling of another.*/

	#process{

		padding-left: 10px;

	}

	/*nth-child (This is not in your reading, but Google how it works. */

            padding: 0px;
            font-weight: bold;
